ðŸ§­ App Introduction
Over the past decade, markets have become increasingly sentiment-driven â€” shaped not only by fundamentals but by investor psychology, fear, greed, and narrative shifts.
Volatility spikes, meme stock frenzies, and algorithmic reactivity have highlighted how emotions can overpower logic in the short term.

This dashboard was built to help bridge that gap between traditional risk metrics and real-world investor behavior.

Specifically, the app integrates:

The AAII Sentiment Survey â€” a contrarian measure of retail investor mood
A CNN-style Fear & Greed Index replica
Tools to translate sentiment signals into risk management frameworks, including:
Dynamic exposure scaling
VaR & CVaR adjustment
Stop-loss triggers
By combining these behavioral indicators with market data, the goal is to help you better understand:

When risk may be mispriced
When to scale in or out of exposure
And how to build adaptive strategies that respond not just to volatility, but to investor psychology
Whether you're a portfolio manager, a quant, or simply a data-driven investor, this dashboard offers an interactive sandbox to explore how sentiment shapes performance.
